### Chapter 3: Time Conversions
**Page 47, section 3.9, step 4**: the parenthetical note is incorrect. It should read “Note that adding 24<sup>h</sup> means that the resulting LCT is for the *previous* day while subtracting 24<sup>h</sup> means that the resulting LCT is for the *next* day.”

**Page 47, section 3.10:** A note should be inserted before the first paragraph. “Note: The time conversion method presented in this section is accurate to approximately a tenth of a second.”

**Page 48, section 3.11:** A note should be inserted before the first paragraph. “Note: The time conversion method presented in this section is accurate to approximately a tenth of a second.”
